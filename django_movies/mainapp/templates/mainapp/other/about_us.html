                Welcome to FilmFlow!
                Hey there! I'm a film-loving student who created FilmFlow, an online cinema platform that brings the magic of the big screen right to your devices.
                Let me tell you a bit about myself and this exciting journey.
            </p>

            <h5 class="movie-bold">Story</h5>
            <p class="about-text">
                FilmFlow was founded by a student who really enjoys movies, but was tired of the limited movie options available online.
                So I decided to create a platform where movie buffs like us could access a vast library of films from all genres and eras.
                After countless late-night brainstorming sessions and a lot of hard work, FilmFlow was born.

            <h5 class="movie-bold">My Mission</h5>
            <p class="about-text">
                My mission at FilmFlow is simple yet profound: to make cinematic experiences accessible to everyone, no matter where they are.
                I believe that movies have the power to inspire, entertain, and educate.
                I strive to curate a diverse collection of movies that cater to different tastes and preferences.
